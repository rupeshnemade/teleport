description: How to set up and configure Teleport for Kubernetes access with SSO and RBAC
h1: Teleport Kubernetes Access
---

Teleport handles SSO and provides a unified access plane for Kubernetes clusters.

* Users can login once using [`tsh login`](cli-docs.mdx#tsh-login) and
  switch between multiple clusters using [`tsh kube login`](cli-docs.mdx#tsh-kube-login).
* Admins can use roles to implement policies like `developers must not access production`.
* Achieve compliance by capturing `kubectl` events and session recordings for `kubectl exec`.

## Teleport Kubernetes Service

By default, the Kubernetes integration is turned off in Teleport. The configuration
setting to enable the integration in the proxy service section in the `/etc/teleport.yaml`
config file, as shown below:

```yaml
# snippet from /etc/teleport.yaml on the Teleport proxy service:
kubernetes_service:
    enabled: yes
    public_addr: [k8s.example.com:3027]
    listen_addr: 0.0.0.0:3027
    kubeconfig_file: /secrets/kubeconfig
```
Let's take a closer look at the available Kubernetes settings:

- `public_addr` defines the publicly accessible address which Kubernetes API clients
  like `kubectl` will connect to. This address will be placed inside of kubeconfig on
  a client's machine when a client executes tsh login command to retrieve its certificate.
  If you intend to run multiple Teleport proxies behind a load balancer, this must
  be the load balancer's public address.

- `listen_addr` defines which network interface and port the Teleport proxy server
  should bind to. It defaults to port 3026 on all NICs.

## Setup

Connecting the Teleport proxy to Kubernetes.

Teleport Auth And Proxy can be ran anywhere (inside or outside of k8s). The Teleport
proxy must have `kube_listen_addr` set and optionally `kube_public_addr` set.

- Options for connecting k8s clusters:
    - `kubernetes_service` in a pod [Using our Helm Chart](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/examples/chart/teleport-kube-agent/README.md)
    - `kubernetes_service` elsewhere, with kubeconfig. Use [get-kubeconfig.sh and merge-kubeconfigs.sh](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/examples/k8s-auth/) for building kubeconfigs

There are two options for setting up Teleport to access Kubernetes:

### Option 1: Standalone Teleport "gateway" for multiple K8s Clusters

A single central Teleport Access Plane acting as "gateway". Multiple Kubernetes clusters
connect to it over reverse tunnels.

The root Teleport Cluster should be setup following our standard config, to make sure
clients can connect you must make sure that an invite token is set for the `kube`
service and proxy_addr has `kube_listen_addr` set.

```yaml
# Example Snippet for the Teleport Root Service
#...
auth_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  listen_addr: 0.0.0.0:3025
  tokens:
  - kube:866c6c114724a0fa4d4d73216afd99fb1a2d6bfde8e13a19
#...
proxy_service:
  public_addr: proxy.example.com:3080
  kube_listen_addr: 0.0.0.0:3027
  # optional: set a different public address for kubernetes access
  kube_public_addr: kube.example.com:3027
```

To get quickly setup, we provide a Helm chart that'll connect to the above root cluster.

```bash
# Add Teleport Helm Repo
$ helm repo add teleport https://charts.releases.teleport.dev

# Installing the Helm Chart
helm install teleport-kube-agent teleport/teleport-kube-agent \
  --namespace teleport \
  --create-namespace \
  --set roles=kube \
  --set proxyAddr=proxy.example.com:3080 \
  --set authToken=$JOIN_TOKEN \
  --set kubeClusterName=$KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_NAME
```

| Things to set | Description |
|-|-|
| `proxyAddr` | The Address of the Teleport Root Service, using the proxy listening port |
| `authToken` | A static `kube` invite token |
| `kubeClusterName` | Kubernetes Cluster name (there is no easy way to automatically detect the name from the environment) |

### Option 2: Proxy running inside a k8s cluster.

Deploy Teleport Proxy service as a Kubernetes pod inside the Kubernetes cluster
you want the proxy to have access to.

```yaml
# snippet from /etc/teleport.yaml on the Teleport proxy service:
auth_service:
  cluster_name: example.com
  public_addr: auth.example.com:3025
# ..
proxy_service:
  public_addr: proxy.example.com:3080
  kube_listen_addr: 0.0.0.0:3026
  # optional: set a different public address for kubernetes access
  kube_public_addr: kube.example.com:3026

kubernetes_service:
  enabled: yes
  listen_addr: 0.0.0.0:3027
  kube_cluster_name: kube.example.com
```

If you're using Helm, we provide a chart that you can use. Run these commands:

```bash
$ helm repo add teleport https://charts.releases.teleport.dev
$ helm install teleport teleport/teleport
```
You will still need a correctly configured `values.yaml` file for this to work. See
our [Helm Docs](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/tree/master/examples/chart/teleport#introduction) for more information.

## Impersonation

<Admonition type="note">
If you used [the helm chart from Option
1](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/examples/k8s-auth/get-kubeconfig.sh)
above, you can skip this step. The script already configured impersonation permissions.
</Admonition>

The next step is to configure the Teleport Proxy to be able to impersonate Kubernetes principals within a given group
using [Kubernetes Impersonation Headers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#user-impersonation).

If Teleport is running inside the cluster using a Kubernetes `ServiceAccount`,
here's an example of the permissions that the `ServiceAccount` will need to be able
to use impersonation (change `teleport-serviceaccount` to the name of the `ServiceAccount`
that's being used):

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: teleport-impersonation
rules:
- apiGroups:
  - ""
  resources:
  - users
  - groups
  - serviceaccounts
  verbs:
  - impersonate
- apiGroups:
  - ""
  resources:
  - pods
  verbs:
  - get
- apiGroups:
  - "authorization.k8s.io"
  resources:
  - selfsubjectaccessreviews
  verbs:
  - create
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: teleport
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: teleport-impersonation
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  # this should be changed to the name of the Kubernetes ServiceAccount being used
  name: teleport-serviceaccount
  namespace: default
```

There is also an [example of this usage](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/examples/chart/teleport/templates/clusterrole.yaml)
within the [example Teleport Helm chart](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/examples/chart/teleport/).

If Teleport is running outside of the Kubernetes cluster, you will need to ensure
that the principal used to connect to Kubernetes via the `kubeconfig` file has the
same impersonation permissions as are described in the `ClusterRole` above.

## Kubernetes RBAC

Once you perform the steps above, your Teleport instance should become a fully
functional Kubernetes API proxy. The next step is to configure Teleport to assign
the correct Kubernetes groups to Teleport users.

Mapping Kubernetes groups to Teleport users depends on how Teleport is
configured. In this guide we'll look at two common configurations:

* **Open source, Teleport Community edition** configured to authenticate users via [Github](admin-guide.mdx#github-oauth-20).
  In this case, we'll need to map Github teams to Kubernetes groups.

* **Commercial, Teleport Enterprise edition** configured to authenticate users via [Okta SSO](enterprise/sso/ssh-okta.mdx).
  In this case, we'll need to map users' groups that come from Okta to Kubernetes
  groups.

## Kubernetes Groups and Users

Teleport provides support for

* Kubernetes Groups, using `kubernetes_groups: ["system:masters"]`.
* Kubernetes Users, using `kubernetes_users: ['barent', 'jane']`. If a Kubernetes
user isn't set the user will impersonate themselves.

When adding new local users you have to specify which Kubernetes groups they
belong to:

``` bash
# Adding a Teleport local user to map to a Kubernetes group.
$ tctl users add joe --k8s-groups="system:masters"
# Adding a Teleport local user to map to a Kubernetes user.
$ tctl users add jenkins --k8s-users="jenkins"
# Enterprise users should manage k8s-users and k8s-groups via RBAC, see Okta Auth
# example below
```

### Kubernetes Labels

Labels can be applied to Kubernetes clusters to provide a better inventory of clusters
and more fined grained RBAC.

```yaml
    # ... Snippet of teleport.yaml
    # Optional labels: These can be used in combination with RBAC rules
    # to limit access to applications.
    # When using kubeconfig_file above, these labels apply to all kubernetes
    # clusters specified in the kubeconfig.
    labels:
      env: "prod"
    # Optional Dynamic Labels
    - name: "os"
       command: ["/usr/bin/uname"]
       period: "5s"
    # Get cluster name on GKE.
    - name: cluster-name
      command: ['curl', 'http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1/instance/attributes/cluster-name', '-H', 'Metadata-Flavor: Google']
      period: 1m0s
```

### Github Auth

When configuring Teleport to authenticate against Github, you have to create a
Teleport connector for Github, like the one shown below. Notice the `kubernetes_groups`
setting which assigns Kubernetes groups to a given Github team:

```yaml
kind: github
version: v3
metadata:
  # connector name that will be used with `tsh --auth=github login`
  name: github
spec:
  # client ID of Github OAuth app
  client_id: <client-id>
  # client secret of Github OAuth app
  client_secret: <client-secret>
  # connector display name that will be shown on web UI login screen
  display: Github
  # callback URL that will be called after successful authentication
  redirect_url: https://teleport.example.com:3080/v1/webapi/github/callback
  # mapping of org/team memberships onto allowed logins and roles
  teams_to_logins:
    - organization: octocats # Github organization name
      team: admin           # Github team name within that organization
      # allowed UNIX logins for team octocats/admin:
      logins:
        - root
      # list of Kubernetes groups this Github team is allowed to connect to
      kubernetes_groups: ["system:masters"]
      # Optional: If not set, users will impersonate themselves.
      # kubernetes_users: ['barent']
```

To obtain client ID and client secret from Github, please follow [Github documentation](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app/) on how to create and register an OAuth
app. Be sure to set the "Authorization callback URL" to the same value as `redirect_url`
in the resource spec.

Finally, create the Github connector with the command: `tctl create -f github.yaml`.
Now, when Teleport users execute the Teleport's `tsh login` command, they will be
prompted to login through the Github SSO and upon successful authentication, they
have access to Kubernetes.

```bsh
# Login via Github SSO and retrieve SSH+Kubernetes certificates:
$ tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com --auth=github login

# Use Kubernetes API!
$ kubectl exec -ti <pod-name>
```

The `kubectl exec` request will be routed through the Teleport proxy and
Teleport will log the audit record and record the session.

<Admonition type="note">
For more information on integrating Teleport with Github SSO, please see the
[Github section in the Admin Manual](admin-guide.mdx#github-oauth-20).
</Admonition>

### Okta Auth

With Okta (or any other SAML/OIDC/Active Directory provider), you must update
Teleport's roles to include the mapping to Kubernetes groups.

Let's assume you have the Teleport role called "admin". Add `kubernetes_groups`
setting to it as shown below:

```yaml
# NOTE: the role definition is edited to remove the unnecessary fields
kind: role
version: v3
metadata:
  name: admin
spec:
  allow:
    # if kubernetes integration is enabled, this setting configures which
    # kubernetes groups the users of this role will be assigned to.
    # note that you can refer to a SAML/OIDC trait via the "external" property bag,
    # this allows you to specify Kubernetes group membership in an identity manager:
    kubernetes_groups: ["system:masters", "{% raw %}{{external.trait_name}}{% endraw %}"]
```

To add `kubernetes_groups` setting to an existing Teleport role, you can either
use the Web UI or `tctl`:

```bsh
# Dump the "admin" role into a file:
$ tctl get roles/admin > admin.yaml
# Edit the file, add kubernetes_groups setting
# and then execute:
$ tctl create -f admin.yaml
```

<Admonition type="tip" title="Advanced Usage">
`{% raw %}{{ external.trait_name }}{% endraw %}` example is shown to demonstrate how to fetch
the Kubernetes groups dynamically from Okta during login. In this case, you
need to define Kubernetes group membership in Okta (as a trait) and use
that trait name in the Teleport role.

Teleport 4.3 has an option to extract the local part from an email claim. This can be helpful
since some operating systems don't support the @ symbol. This means by using `logins: ['{% raw %}{{email.local(external.email)}}{% endraw %}']` the resulting output will be `dave.smith` if the email was dave.smith@acme.com.
</Admonition>

Once setup is complete, when users execute `tsh login` and go through the usual Okta login
sequence, their `kubeconfig` will be updated with their Kubernetes credentials.

[Okta integration guide](enterprise/sso/ssh-okta.mdx).

## Using Teleport Kubernetes with Automation

Teleport can integrate with CI/CD tooling for greater visibility and auditability of
these tools. For this we recommend creating a local Teleport user, then exporting
a kubeconfig using [`tctl auth sign`](cli-docs.mdx#tctl-auth-sign)

An example setup is below.

```bash
# Create a new local user for Jenkins
$ tctl users add jenkins
# Option 1: Creates a token for 1 year
$ tctl auth sign --user=jenkins --format=kubernetes --out=kubeconfig --ttl=8760h
# Recommended Option 2: Creates a token for 25hrs
$ tctl auth sign --user=jenkins --format=kubernetes --out=kubeconfig --ttl=25h

  The credentials have been written to kubeconfig

$ cat kubeconfig
  apiVersion: v1
  clusters:
  - cluster:
      certificate-authority-data: LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBDRVJUSUZ....
# This kubeconfig can now be exported and will provide access to the automation tooling.

# Uses kubectl to get pods, using the provided kubeconfig.
$ kubectl --kubeconfig /path/to/kubeconfig get pods
```

<Admonition type="tip" title="How long should TTL be?">
In the above example we've provided two options. One with 1yr (8760h) time to live
and one for just 25hrs. As proponents of short lived SSH certificates we recommend
the same for automation.

Handling secrets is out of scope of our docs, but at a high level we recommend
using providers secrets managers. Such as [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/),
[GCP Secrets Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager), or on prem using
a project like [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/).  Then running a nightly
job on the auth server to sign and publish a new kubeconfig. In our example, we've
added 1hr, and during this time both kubeconfigs will be valid.

Taking this a step further you could build a system to request a very short lived
token for each CI run. We plan to make this easier for operators to integrate in
the future by exposing and documenting more of our API.

## AWS EKS

We've a complete guide on setting up Teleport with EKS. Please see the [Using Teleport with EKS Guide](aws-oss-guide.mdx#using-teleport-with-eks).

## Multiple Kubernetes Clusters via Teleport Access Plane

Teleport 5.0 adds the [long requested feature](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/3680)
of supporting multiple Kubernetes Clusters via a single Teleport Root. This setup is
described in Option 1 and uses reverse tunnels to connect back to the root cluster.

Teleport provides an option for running a single Teleport instance. This can be
done using Option 2 and a single kubeconfig with multiple entries. You can
combine multiple kubeconfig files into one using
[merge-kubeconfigs.sh](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/examples/k8s-auth/merge-kubeconfigs.sh).

## Multiple Kubernetes Clusters via Trusted Cluster

You can take advantage of the [Trusted Clusters](trustedclusters.mdx) feature of
Teleport to federate trust across multiple Kubernetes clusters.

When multiple trusted clusters are present behind a Teleport proxy, the
`kubeconfig` generated by [ `tsh login` ](cli-docs.mdx#tsh-login) will contain the
Kubernetes API endpoint determined by the `<cluster>` argument to [`tsh
login`](cli-docs.mdx#tsh-login) .

For example, consider the following setup:

* There are three Teleport/Kubernetes clusters: "main", "east" and "west". These
  are the names set in `cluster_name` setting in their configuration files.
* The clusters "east" and "west" are trusted clusters for "main".
* Users always authenticate against "main" but use their certificates to access
  SSH nodes and Kubernetes API in all three clusters.
* The DNS name of the main proxy server is "main.example.com"

In this scenario, users usually login using this command:

``` bash
# Using login without arguments
$ tsh --proxy=main.example.com login

# user's `kubeconfig` now contains one entry for the main Kubernetes
# endpoint, i.e. `proxy.example.com` .

# Receive a certificate for "east":
$ tsh --proxy=main.example.com login east

# user's `kubeconfig` now contains the entry for the "east" Kubernetes
# endpoint, i.e. `east.proxy.example.com` .
```
